This test suite will generate an image using each of the major functions and save it to the output folder for both Typescript and Javascript executions.  

The test suite then compares the output to ensure that the same images are generated from both Typescript and Javascript executions.

To run the test suite, run the following in the command line:

```bash
./test.sh
```
